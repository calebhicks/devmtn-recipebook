DevMtn Class Project Recipe Book
================================

Recipe Book is a project we are working on in class to learn about protocols and delegates in iOS development.

Protocol: required and optional methods to use a particular feature (ex. Tableviews require two methods, one to define cells, and one to tell how many cells in the section).

Delegate: Similar to the app delegate, a delegate will tell the application when certain events have occurred. For example, if the user has tapped or scrolled. For what we've learned thus far, view controllers will typically be their own delegates. 


Disclaimer:

This repo is going to be pretty much useless to you. I'm doing an iOS coding bootcamp through DevMountain in Provo, Utah. And most of my work will end up here on GitHub in repos like this one.

Take a look if you want to laugh at some code. If you're checking this out and have some feedback, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks.
