About This Repo

This repo is going to be pretty much useless to you. I'm doing an iOS coding bootcamp through DevMountain in Provo, Utah. And most of my work will end up here on GitHub in repos like this one.

Take a look if you want to laugh at some code. If you're checking this out and have some feedback, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks.
